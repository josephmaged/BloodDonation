        <h1>About Us </h1>
        <p>Each day, thousands of people – people just like you – provide compassionate care to those in need. Our network of generous donors, volunteers and employees share a mission of preventing and relieving suffering, here at home and around the world.
            <br><br>
            We roll up our sleeves and donate time, money and blood. We learn or teach life-saving skills so our communities can be better prepared when the need arises. We do this every day because the Red Vein is needed - every day.
            <br><br>
            There are eight different blood types and each one holds a unique power to save lives. OneBlood’s exclusive the Red Vein program shows donors how to give the most needed components of their blood by targeting how they donate. Click on the blood types below and learn how to unlock the power of your blood type and save more lives.
            <br><br>
            Blood transfusion is a complicated science. Many people don’t realize that there are many other variants besides blood type that can be a factor for compatibility. Many times these factors are related to your ethnicity, making your donation that much more important to patients in need.                            <br><br>
            Learn about the blood donation process and the journey your donated blood travels from collection to distribution, including how potential donors are screened and how the blood is processed, tested and stored.
